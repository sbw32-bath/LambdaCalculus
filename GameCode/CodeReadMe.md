# 🧩 Functionia: The Lambda Loom

> *“Apply... define... become...”*

Welcome to **Functionia: The Lambda Loom**, a symbolic, narrative-driven puzzle game that weaves abstract thought, logic, and identity through a beautifully stylized Unreal Engine world grounded in the principles of **lambda calculus**.

---

## 🌌 Story Overview

Functionia was once a radiant realm, where reality itself was shaped by pure thought through the metaphysical **Lambda Loom**. But after the catastrophic **Reduction Collapse**, logic, time, and meaning fractured. You are the **Syntax Seeker**, drawn from the rigid realm of *Imperativa*, guided only by the ancient symbol: `λ`.

Your journey: to reawaken the Lambda Loom and restore **foundational principles**—identity, abstraction, recursion, truth, logic gates, and more.
