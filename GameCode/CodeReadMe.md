## Character Bios

### 1. Cam Arlen
- **Role:** Protagonist
- **Background:** A linguist-turned-IT tech with a knack for pattern recognition. Curious, skeptical, and quietly brilliant.

### 2. The Mentor ("Lambda Sage")
- **Role:** Guide (Voice/Hologram)
- **Background:** Former Order member who mysteriously vanished.
- **Personality:** Cryptic, poetic, a philosophical teacher.

### 3. The Curators
- **Role:** Guardians of different logic gates
- **Types:** Numeral Keeper, Substitution Guardian, Fixpoint Prophet
- **Quirk:** Speak in encoded lambda expressions until decoded.

### 4. Omega
- **Role:** Antagonist/Rival
- **Background:** Failed initiate obsessed with breaking recursion.
- **Fight Style:** Uses infinite loops, paradoxes, and traps.

### 5. Archive Keeper
- **Role:** Logic AI guarding the Library
- **Speech:** Alternates between riddles and pure lambda expressions.

### 6. Mirror Cams
- **Role:** Psychological opponents
- **Theme:** Each reflects a possible “truth” of Cam’s identity.

- A glowing rune, seen on cloaks, terminals, and thresholds.

### 2. Subway to Lambda Central
- Gothic steampunk vibes; cryptic code scribbled on windows.

### 3. Church of Combinators
- Techno-cathedral, stained-glass of logic expressions.

### 4. The Archive
- A glowing, endless library; books float and rearrange.

## Learning Module & Gameplay Map

### Act 1: Foundation
- **Concepts:** Identity function, basic syntax.
- **Puzzles:** Evaluate `(λx.x) a`, decode a name using abstraction.

### Act 2: Abstraction
- **Concepts:** Function abstraction, currying, Church numerals.
- **Puzzles:** Encode names with nested `λ`, manipulate numeric data via Church encoding.

### Act 3: Control
- **Concepts:** Booleans, conditionals, logical flow.
- **Puzzles:** Navigate logic maze; simulate `if-then-else` with lambda functions.

### Act 4: Recursion & Identity
- **Concepts:** Y combinator, fixpoints, infinite reductions.
- **Puzzles:** Fix recursive expressions, detect looping structures, reflect identity via substitution logic.

### Act 5: Synthesis
- **Concepts:** SKI combinators, program as logical transformation.
- **Final Challenge:** Reduce a mega-expression composed of all learned elements to determine game ending.

## Optional Game Systems

- **Symbol Editor:** Drag-and-drop logic board to construct and reduce lambda expressions.
- **Function Duel System:** Turn-based symbolic logic battles with rival characters.
- **Memory Map:** Visual graph of expressions Cam has encountered, solved, and created.
- **New Game+:** Start over as a new Curator with access to deeper logical constructs.
