## 🎮 About the Game

**"The Order of the Red Lambda"** is a serious game that teaches lambda calculus through an unfolding mystery, blending narrative exploration with formal logic puzzles. You play as **Cam Arlen**, a former computational linguist who discovers a hidden world where **functions shape reality**.

- 📚 Learn functional programming concepts from scratch  
- 🧩 Solve logic puzzles in immersive environments  
- 🌀 Battle symbolic foes using recursive strategy  
- 🧠 Question the nature of identity, computation, and self

## 📖 Game Storyline

### **ACT 1: INITIATION**
**Theme:** “There is something hidden beneath the surface.”

- **Scene 1: The Office**  
  A mysterious USB opens a cryptic command line program. You solve `λx.x` and trigger a message: “You’ve opened the door.”

- **Scene 2: Cam’s Apartment**  
  Symbols in your home come alive. You unlock secrets using beta-reduction and find a journal about a secret Order.

- **Scene 3: Train Ride**  
  The train to a hidden address folds itself into an abstraction. A child gives you a drawing: Church numeral 2.

### **ACT 2: THE ORDER**
**Theme:** “The world is built from functions—you just never looked closely.”

- **Scene 4: The Church of Combinators**  
  You’re tested at the cathedral: encode your name as a lambda function. The Order accepts you.

- **Scene 5: The Archive**  
  Solve Church numeral-based locks. Discover the Order’s past and a warning: “Don’t trust the Inner Circle.”

- **Scene 6: Hall of Mirrors**  
  Face abstract versions of yourself using alpha-renaming. Your identity is no longer stable.

### **ACT 3: TRUTH FUNCTIONS**
**Theme:** “To control logic is to control choice.”

- **Scene 7: The Labyrinth**  
  Navigate a maze using Boolean logic gates and lambda-based conditions.

- **Scene 8: Combinator Arena**  
  Duel an initiate using SKI combinators and recursion. Unlock the **Y combinator**.

### **ACT 4: REDUCTION POINT**
**Theme:** “The path to self is the path to paradox.”

- **Scene 9: Archive Revisited**  
  The system collapses into non-termination and Ω traps. Restore logic from recursive chaos.

- **Scene 10: Temple of Identity**  
  Rebuild your self from symbolic expressions. Are you still Cam or just a function?

### **ACT 5: THE FINAL DECISION**
**Theme:** “You are the abstraction now.”

- **Scene 11: Inner Sanctum**  
  Three endings:
  1. Spread abstraction to humanity
  2. Destroy the Order
  3. Abstract yourself and transcend

Reduce a final combinatory expression to seal your fate.
